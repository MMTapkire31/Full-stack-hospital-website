# Hospital Management Website

## Overview
The Hospital Management Website is a web-based system developed to digitize hospital operations such as appointment booking, prescription handling, medicine delivery, and lab report management. The platform reduces patient waiting time and improves hospital workflow efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Traditional hospital processes require patients to physically visit hospitals for appointment booking, purchasing medicines, and collecting reports, which leads to long queues and inefficient record handling. This system provides an online solution to streamline these operations.

## Features
- Real-time appointment booking and cancellation
- Email confirmation for appointments
- Prescription upload for home delivery of medicines
- Secure lab report download with authentication
- Chatbot for answering basic patient queries (OPD timings, etc.)
- Admin panel for managing appointments, prescriptions, and reports

## Technology Stack
- Backend: Django, Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Database: SQLite
- Additional: Basic Machine Learning libraries for chatbot
